  - NewYearMoviesBot is created to send Christmas and New Year movies like an advent calendar. A user receives movies to watch every day from 4 December till 7 January. 
  - InstagramHelperBot can be used to get the most popular hashtags by keywords as well as captions for them. 
  - IndoTaxHelperBot is a tiny bot to add Indonesian taxes to the price. It's very useful in cafes because all prices usually don't include taxes by default.
